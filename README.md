# Adoption_Stoplight
Repository for the animal adoption stoplight

This program will allow a volunteer to see if an animal needs to be marketed upon entering the animal shelter
It will result in a "stoplight" where people can see if they need to market the animal

Animal will be checked for high, medium, or low risk of being a "long-termer" and will then be given a message whether to market the animal or not.
